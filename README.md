# Roblox-Scripting-Shortcuts
# Description
This rep is for your scripting needs in roblox. Some (Not all of them.) [Roblox Globals](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/globals/RobloxGlobals), [Lua Globals](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/globals/LuaGlobals), [Libraries](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine#libraries), [Data Types](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine#data-types) ([Enums](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine#enums) NOT INCLUDED) are all shortened in a single line!
This rep also includes some useful [ModuleScripts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript) from the internet, including some old [Rbx ModuleScripts](https://devforum.roblox.com/uploads/short-url/bSMD1kiXg4uFGtNPDnTo2PpHu1A.rbxmx).
> [ModuleScripts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript) are used to shorten the script lines.
